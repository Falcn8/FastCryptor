# Fast XOR File Encryption/Decryption

This project contains a pair of C++ programs for encrypting and decrypting files using the XOR cipher. The programs are designed to be fast and efficient, and can encrypt/decrypt entire directories, including subdirectories. The programs are written in C++ and are cross-platform. The programs are designed to be used in the terminal. I also added a `compile.sh` file to compile the programs.

## Features

- Encrypts files using a user-defined key.
- Decrypts files encrypted using the encryption program.
- Can encrypt/decrypt entire directories, including subdirectories.

---

## Usage

### Compile

To compile the programs, run the `compile.sh` file. This will compile the programs and place the executables in the `build/` directory.

### Encryption

To encrypt a directory, run the encryption program in the directory you want to encrypt.

### Decryption

To decrypt a directory, run the decryption program in the directory you want to decrypt.

## Note

- Make sure to keep the key used for encryption safe, as it is required for decryption.
- Use this program at your own risk. The author takes no responsibility for any data loss or corruption that may occur.
